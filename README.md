# Non-Uniform-Meshed-Schrodinger-Poisson-Equation-Solver
This is project is part of the EE-723 (Physics of Nanoelectronic Devices-I course) which I had taken at IIT Bombay. I have implemented non-uniform mesh to solve schrodinger equation and demonstrated the speed-up taking the simple case of a finite potential well. This is the ref. paper: https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.346245
